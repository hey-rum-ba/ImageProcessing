How YOLO works is that we take an image and split it into an SxS grid, within each of the grid we take m bounding boxes. For each of the bounding box, the network outputs a class probability and offset values for the bounding box. The bounding boxes having the class probability above a threshold value is selected and used to locate the object within the image.
YOLO is orders of magnitude faster(45 frames per second) than other object detection algorithms. The limitation of YOLO algorithm is that it struggles with small objects within the image, for example it might have difficulties in detecting a flock of birds. This is due to the spatial constraints of the algorithm.
